# scrcpy-gui
A simple GUI for launching https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy

I'm intentionally not making any effort to make it look good, this is more a way for me to see how I can quickly whip up a simple GUI for simple tasks than an actual thing I intend to use (or intend for other people to use)
